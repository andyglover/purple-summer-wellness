					<p>
						Hello! My name is Leilani and I am the owner of Purple Summer Wellness. I
						am a Nationally Board Certified Reflexologist and Usui Reiki Master, and I
						am so glad you are here. Raised in the Pacific Northwest, I graduated from
						Pacific Conservatory of Performing Arts in Santa Maria, California and am
						currently putting that education to use as Assistant Director at the
						Auburn Mountainview Theatre Company.
					</p>
					<p>
						I believe in the power of words, sunshine, and an honest day's work. When
						I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong (thank you, Dirty Dancing! Who says you can't
						learn anything from movies!?)
					</p>
					<p>
						I would describe myself as a shameless bibliophile and avocado enthusiast.
						When not working, I can be found nerd-dating with my husband (he plays a
						video game while I read), taking our rescue dog, Karma, for a walk, or
						binge watching a show while I crochet a blanket!

					<div style="text-align: center"><h2>MY STORY</h2></div>
					<p>
						I received my first Reiki session in 2002, but it wasn’t until 2010 that I
						got my Level 1 attunement, working my way to my Level 3 attunement (master
						level) in 2017. Through the years, I have wanted to be a Reiki
						Practitioner full time, I just wasn’t sure how I was going to make that
						work. In 2015, I sustained an injury that left me with nerve damage and
						ended my 11 year career with a company I loved. Through that healing
						process was the first time I thought to myself "I should do reflexology"
						Though, too scared to make that leap, I started with another company and
						created a corporate career I thought I wanted. Inevitably, that was not
						filling my cup and the stress led me into a 6 month long migraine. I
						started using some reflex points I had learned casually, and it dawned on
						me that I had the power to change my life - I just needed the courage. So,
						with the support of my family and friends, I embarked on what I refer to
						as "My Trustfall Year". I quit my corporate job, and enrolled with
						<a href="#">Reflexology Academy Northwest</a>
						.
					</p>
					<p>
						Years ago I escaped an abusive relationship, and that experience taught me
						how emotional/mental trauma can have as profound an impact on the body as
						physical trauma can. Because of that, I am working my way through classes
						to become a Trauma Informed Practitioner. I cannot wait to put these
						skills into practice for those who need them.
					</p>
					<p>
						I believe my experience teaching has taught me how to create a safe space
						for students to take chances and express themselves. And I hope that is
						what I can bring into my room: a safe space for you to be seen and
						acknowledged.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="white-card about-section nav-section" id="philosophy">
					<div style="text-align: center"><h2>MY PHILOSOPHY</h2></div>
					<p>
						I believe in the body's innate ability to heal.
						<br />
						Our bodies are amazing. They house us, hold us, and propel us through this
						maze, and sometimes mess, of a life.
						<br />
						It is in that "mess" that we can find our body's super power: Its innate
						ability to heal.
					</p>
					<p>
						And sometimes, our bodies need help remembering how amazing they truly
						are.
						<br />
						"I did not come to heal, I came to love. Love will heal." -unknown
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>I am not a doctor.</strong>
						I do not claim to diagnose, treat or heal.
						<br />
						<strong>I am not a "healer"</strong>
						- merely a witness to your divine inner magic.
					</p>
					<p>I believe EVERY BODY deserves a chance to heal.</p>
					<p>
						I may not be able to change the world, but I can work to be sure my little
						corner of it is safe.

					<div style="text-align: left"><h2>WHAT IS REFLEXOLOGY?</h2></div>
					<br />
					<p>
						Reflexology is based in the idea that your whole body, every system that
						keeps us alive and moving, can be mapped out on the soles of your feet (as
						well as the palms of your hands and on your ears). By applying contact to
						certain areas, we can help bring the body back to homeostasis so it can
						perform to the best of its ability. Similar to acupuncture in the idea of
						helping to remove blockages, with more of a massage-type experience,
						Reflexology is performed with the client lying, fully clothed except
						socks, on a massage table or in a zero gravity chair. The pant legs may be
						moved up to allow for access to the calf.
					</p>
					<p>
						Reflexology has been known to increase circulation, and increased blood
						flow decreases inflammation. When inflammation is decreased, we often see
						a reduction of pain. Other ailments that people have reported to be helped
						by Reflexology are: headaches/migraines, back pain, bowel movements,
						kidney stones, and blood pressure.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the medical community, Reflexology is what is known as a
						Complementary/Alternative Modality (CAM). Other CAMs include: Acupuncture,
						massage, yoga, meditation, and holistic medicines - just to name a few.
						This also means that if you have a serious health condition, you should
						always seek the advice of your primary care physician or specialist.

						<h2>HOW TO PREPARE FOR YOUR SESSION</h2>
					</div>
					<br />
					<p>
						<strong>PREPARE TO ARRIVE EARLY:</strong>
						If this is your first session, prepare to arrive 15 min early to fill out
						the required paperwork. If you take a lot of medications or have had a lot
						of ailments/diagnosis/surgeries, please be ready to list those, or bring
						out a printed copy I can keep for your files.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>WHAT TO WEAR:</strong>
						No matter which service you are seeking, you will remain fully clothed*,
						so dress in what ever makes you comfortable. I do recommend layers as
						sometimes this type of work can fluctuate your body temperature. I always
						keep blankets on hand in case you get cold, and a fan if you get hot. My
						only ask is that you refrain from wearing perfume or heavily scented body
						products, as these can induce headaches and aggravate breathing.
						<br />
						<span class="disclaimer">
							*for a Reflexology session, I will remove your socks, and possibly move
							your pant legs up to allow access to your calf.
						</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>DURING THE SESSION:</strong>
						This is your time. We can talk or not. You can talk, and I can listen. I
						prefer if you do not engage with your cellphone, but that is ultimately up
						to you. I do play music, but if you prefer some sort of white/green/pink
						noise, that can be arranged.
						<br />
						Energy work as well as touch can bring to the surface many emotions we may
						expect, and plenty we may not! I have had people laugh, scream, and even
						sob uncontrollably. Some reactions may be more physical: Noises of
						digestion, burps, the sudden urge to use the restroom - all of it normal!
						Whatever course your body takes during our time together, there is no
						judgement. My room is a safe space for your body to express, expel, and
						engage what ever energy it needs in that moment.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>AFTER THE SESSION:</strong>
						I will gently bring you back into your body and the space. Take your time
						sitting up. You may continue to experience fluctuation body temperature
						and/or emotional responses, this is completely normal. Personally, I find
						keeping up my water intake after a session helps me a great deal. People
						joke about the "emotional support water bottle" fad, but personally, I'm a
						fan!

					<div style="text-align: left"><h2>FAQ</h2></div>
					<br />
					<div class="faq-item">
						<span class="faq-question">Isn’t Reflexology just a foot massage?</span>
						<p>
							Whereas a Reflexology session can feel as wonderful as a foot massage, it
							is more than that! Relaxation is of course a major benefit that echos
							that of a foot massage, but when a Certified Reflexologist is working on
							your feet, our focus is what your feet are telling us about the rest of
							your body. We are feeling for differences in textures that may point to a
							blockage of energy somewhere in your body, and we work that point in
							hopes to help the stimulation the flow of blood and energy that your body
							is asking for. And yes, your massage therapist might have taken CE
							classes for reflexology, or they may also be a Certified Reflexologist on
							top of being an LMP. If you have a massage therapist you love, ask them
							about it!
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<span class="faq-question">
							Will I automatically receive Reiki during a Reflexology session?
						</span>
						<p>
							No, you will not. One of the first things we learn in/about Reiki, is
							respect and consent. Practitioners are never to perform/give Reiki to a
							person who is unwilling or unaware. Reiki is a deeply personal
							experience, and should be used with the utmost respect. Just like any
							other body work modality - I would never just grab someone's feet and
							start giving them session out of the blue, so in turn, I would not focus
							my Reiki intention onto you without discussing it with you first.
							<br />
							Now, that caveat to this is: I am always running Reiki on myself, so you
							may feel that energy from me, but it is not focused on you. It keeps me
							balanced, grounded and protected.
